  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/images/
   - assets/fonts/tajawal/
   - assets/fonts/lato/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Tajawal
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/tajawal/Tajawal-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/tajawal/Tajawal-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/tajawal/Tajawal-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400

    - family: Lato
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/lato/Lato-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/lato/Lato-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400


  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
